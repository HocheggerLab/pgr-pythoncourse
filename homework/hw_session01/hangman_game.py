# Step 1: Choose a secret word
# Define a word that the player has to guess.
# You can either pre-define the word or select one randomly from a list of words.


# Step 2: Display the word with hidden letters
# Create a display where the letters of the word are replaced by underscores.
# For example, if the word is 'python', the display should initially be '_ _ _ _ _ _'.
# The display will be updated as the player guesses correctly.

# Step 3: Set up the player's guessing input
# Prompt the player to guess a letter. 
# Make sure the input is valid (it should be a single letter, and not already guessed).

# Step 4: Keep track of correct and incorrect guesses
# Maintain a list of correctly guessed letters.
# Also, maintain a separate list of incorrect guesses to keep track of how many wrong guesses the player has made.

# Step 5: Update the word display
# For each correct guess, update the display by replacing the appropriate underscores with the guessed letter(s).
# If the player guesses 'p' and the word is 'python', the display should become 'p _ _ _ _ _'.

# Step 6: Limit the number of incorrect guesses
# Set a limit on how many incorrect guesses the player can make (typically 6).
# After each incorrect guess, decrease the remaining guesses and give feedback to the player.

# Step 7: (Optional) Display a hangman drawing
# For each incorrect guess, you can update a text-based drawing of the hangman.
# This is purely for visualizing the progress of the game and adds an element of tension.

# Step 8: Check for win or loss conditions
# The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before reaching the maximum number of wrong guesses.
# The player loses if they exceed the maximum number of incorrect guesses before completing the word.

# Step 9: End the game and reveal the word
# Once the game ends (either with a win or loss), reveal the full word to the player.
# Optionally, provide a way to start a new game or exit.

# Step 10: Optional enhancements
# You could improve the game by showing letters already guessed, allowing the player to guess the whole word,
# selecting words randomly from a larger list, or keeping score across multiple rounds.
