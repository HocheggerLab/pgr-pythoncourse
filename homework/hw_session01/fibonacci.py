# Step 1: Define the Fibonacci sequence
# The Fibonacci sequence starts with two numbers: 0 and 1.
# Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
# For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

# Step 2: Get user input for how many numbers to generate
# Ask the user how many Fibonacci numbers they want to generate.
# Store this input in a variable and ensure it is an integer.

# Step 3: Handle edge cases
# Consider the cases where the user asks for 0 or 1 Fibonacci numbers.
# For 0, simply return an empty list.
# For 1, return [0], since the first Fibonacci number is 0.

# Step 4: Initialize the Fibonacci sequence
# Create a list or variable to store the Fibonacci sequence.
# Start with the first two numbers, 0 and 1.

# Step 5: Generate the Fibonacci numbers
# Use a loop to generate the next numbers in the sequence.
# Each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
# Append each new number to the list of Fibonacci numbers.

# Step 6: Output the Fibonacci sequence
# Once the desired number of Fibonacci numbers has been generated, print the sequence.

# Step 7: Optional enhancement – use recursion
# Instead of using a loop, you could implement the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
# However, be mindful that recursion can be less efficient for large numbers.

# Step 8: Optional enhancement – memoization
# You can optimize the recursive solution by using memoization.
# This technique involves storing already computed Fibonacci numbers so they don't have to be recalculated.
