    "Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code over time. It provides a robust and efficient way to manage source code, enabling multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously while keeping a history of all modifications. Git facilitates collaboration, branch management, and merging of code changes. On the other hand, GitHub is a web-based hosting service built around Git. It provides a platform for developers to store, share, and collaborate on Git repositories. GitHub offers additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools, making it a popular choice for open-source and private software development projects.\n",
