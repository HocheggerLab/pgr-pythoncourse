    "## What Are Python Virtual Environments?\n",
    "A Python virtual environment consists of two essential components: the Python interpreter that the virtual environment runs on and a folder containing third-party libraries installed in the virtual environment. These virtual environments are isolated from the other virtual environments, which means any changes on dependencies installed in a virtual environment donâ€™t affect the dependencies of the other virtual environments or the system-wide libraries. Thus, we can create multiple virtual environments with different Python versions, plus different libraries or the same libraries in different versions.\n",
